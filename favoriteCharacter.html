    <p><em>Kirito</em>, the protagonist of "<strong>Sword Art Online</strong>," is my favorite character due to his exceptional skills, unwavering determination, and deep sense of loyalty. His journey through various virtual worlds showcases his growth as both a swordsman and a person. Kirito's ability to adapt to challenges, protect his friends, and maintain his humanity in a digital realm makes him an inspiring figure. His character embodies themes of courage, friendship, and resilience, which resonate deeply with me.</p>
